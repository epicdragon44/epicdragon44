Hi! I'm Daniel Wei!

I study Computer Science at Cornell University, and I'm minoring in UX Design and East Asian Studies.

Things I'm somewhat decent at:
- SWE
- Start-Ups
- Design
- Management

I've worked at:
- Instapath (YC W19) <> Software Engineer Intern
- Yoomi Health <> Senior Software Engineer
- Cornell DTI <> Lead of Development

In my free time, you'll catch me:
- kayaking
- composing music
- doomscrolling on Twitter
- re-watching Start-Up (the kdrama) in my room.

Stuff that fascinates me:
- really good web development
    - let's get better at reactivity, state management, styling, and testing.
- really great design
    - ChatGPT won't take this one, promise.
- the beauty of the things we build, the things we don't, and everything in-between.
    - brutalism. doors. diasporic nations. bullet trains. saturn's rings.
    - if you've read this far, take a screen break and look outside.
